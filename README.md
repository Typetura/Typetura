# Using typetura

Typetura is a tool to make fluid typography easy. Here is a [demo of typetura in action](http://typetura-js.netlify.com). It enables you to control the font size, line height, margins, padding, variable font settings, and anything that can be animated. The difference is that the keyframes are applied across screen sizes as opposed to time.

# Installing typetura on your website

```bash
npm install --save typeturajs
```

## Via script tag

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/scottkellum/typetura.js@master/js/typetura.min.js"></script>
```

## commonJS

```javascript
import 'typeturajs';
```

## Start styling with CSS! :tada:

### Starting with the basics

At its core, Typetura works with [CSS keyframe animations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@keyframes) and ties those animations to the width of the page or [an element](#Work-off-the-width-of-an-element-and-more) instead of a timeline. Let‚Äôs create keyframes for our `<h1>`.

```css
@keyframes h1 {
  0%,
  20% {
    font-size: 1.2rem;
  }
  100% {
    font-size: 4rem;
  }
}
```

Now that you have your keyframes set up, let‚Äôs tell typetura to use those keyframes to scale the text.

```css
h1 {
  --tt-key: h1;
}
```

Awesome! You should be seeing typetura working. But you might be thinking the effect is happening over too wide a range. By default, the keyframes map to a viewport range of `0px` to `1600px` wide. Change the max to `960px` adding `--tt-max: 960;` either locally on the `h1` or globally on the `body`.

So far, your CSS should look something like this:

```css
@keyframes h1 {
  0% {
    font-size: 1.2rem;
  }
  100% {
    font-size: 4rem;
  }
}
h1 {
  --tt-key: h1;
  --tt-max: 960;
}
```

Anything that can be animated can be used in these keyframes like color, transforms, size, margins, padding, variable font properties, etc. The sky is the limit.

### Work off the width of an element and more

By default typetura queries the width of the viewport. You can select any other element by adding the class `typetura` to that element. With this class, all child elements will respond to that parent context.

### Custom easing

Easing works in typetura just like it does with any other animations. However you may want the easing functions you set to inherit and the default timing functions don‚Äôt. You can set your timing functions in typetura with `--tt-ease` and that timing function will be inherited by any element underneath it.

### Index

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Property
    <th>Accepted values
    <th>Inherits
    <th>Default value
<tr>
  <td><code>--tt-key</code>
  <td><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-name">The keyframes name (string)</a>
  <td>no
  <td><code>none</code>
<tr>
  <td><code>--tt-max</code>
  <td>Value at witch the animation ends (number)
  <td>yes
  <td><code>1600</code>
<tr>
  <td><code>--tt-ease</code>
  <td><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-timing-function">Animation easing function</a>
  <td>yes
  <td><code>linear</code>
<tr>
  <td><code>--tt-bind</code>
  <td>Position of the animation between <code>0s</code> and <code>-1s</code>
  <td>yes
  <td>Auto-generated
</table>

### Browser support

Typetura.js works in Firefox (Gecko), Chrome (Blink), and Safari\* (Webkit). It can be treated as progressive enhancement in all other browsers.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th style="width: 25%">‚úÖ Firefox</th>
    <th style="width: 25%">‚úÖ Chrome</th>
    <th style="width: 25%">‚úÖ Edge</th>
    <th style="width: 25%">‚úÖ Safari/Webkit</th>
  </tr>
<tr>
  <td style="vertical-align: top;">Fully supported</td>
  <td style="vertical-align: top;">Fully supported</td>
  <td style="vertical-align: top;"><p>Supported</p><p>üíÅ‚ÄçEdge 44 and below will render elements one time, when they are styled in the DOM. Chromium builds of Edge allow for fluid browser resizing.</p></td>
  <td style="vertical-align: top;"><p>Supported</p><p>üíÅ‚Äç<a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=194749"><code>em</code> units compound incorrectly</a>. Use <code>rem</code> instead.</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>
