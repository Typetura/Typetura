Typetura is a different way to typeset your website. It allows you to create headlines, pull quotes, labels, and other text elements that respond to the container they are in, as opposed to the viewport. This means you can use the same headline style everywhere, from your sidebar to your page heading without, no breakpoints or layout specific styling. When used effectively, this can reduce your typographic styles by up to 90% and save 20% of your time as you will write far fewer typographic styles. Typetura also supports variable font adjustments, easing curves, is progressively enhanced, and is styled with CSS to offer the most feature rich and easy to use experience possible. We also offer [pre-typeset packages](https://typetura.com/typography-packages) and [assistance integrating Typetura into your projects](https://typetura.com/typography-services).

# Adding Typetura to your website

```bash
npm install --save typeturajs
```

## Via script tag

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/scottkellum/typetura.js@master/js/typetura.min.js"></script>
```

## commonJS

```javascript
import 'typeturajs';
```

# Usage

To get Typetura to work effectively, we need to do two things; [defining contexts](#defining-contexts) and [authoring styles](#authoring-styles) for your typographic components. Combined, these components will respond to your contexts and you will have a robust and responsive typographic system that will work regardless of the device or layout it‚Äôs used in.

## Defining contexts

By default, the viewport is a context. Additional contexts can be added to a page with the `typetura` class. We recommend you create a new context everywhere you have a new column of text.

## Authoring styles

Typetura styles are written using [CSS Keyframe animation syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@keyframes) in your styles. So a good place to start is to define how the text might look at the smallest size possible and how it looks when the context is at its largest size. You can add any [animatable CSS properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animated_properties) to these keyframes, and yes, this means you can manipulate variable fonts as well!.

```css
@keyframes typetura-headline {
  0% {
    font-size: 1rem;
    line-height: 1.15;
    font-weight: 700;
  }
  100% {
    font-size: 5rem;
    line-height: 1;
    font-weight: 300;
  }
}
```

Now, we need to attach these keyframes to the element we wish to style. For this we have a CSS custom property. Let‚Äôs also add some fallback styles just in case there is an issue with Typetura.

```css
.typetura-headline {
  --tt-key: typetura-headline;
  font-size: 1.6rem;
  line-height: 1.05;
  font-weight: 600;
}
```

Now, your headline will fluidly respond to layout changes. But you may not be satisfied with how it is changing in certain places. You can change the maximum width using `--tt-max` to a value that is the maximum width of your context. If your text column only gets as wide as 800px, set it to `--tt-max: 800;`. You may also want to adjust the rate at which your text scales. To do this use `--tt-ease`. These additional properties along with the keyframes will look like this:

```css
.typetura-headline {
  --tt-key: typetura-headline;
  --tt-max: 800;
  --tt-ease: ease-out;
  font-size: 1.6rem;
  line-height: 1.05;
  font-weight: 600;
}
@keyframes typetura-headline {
  0% {
    font-size: 1rem;
    line-height: 1.15;
    font-weight: 700;
  }
  100% {
    font-size: 5rem;
    line-height: 1;
    font-weight: 300;
  }
}
```
