Typetura is a different way to typeset your website. It allows you to create headlines, pull quotes, labels, and other text elements that respond to the container they are in, as opposed to the viewport. This means you can use the same headline style everywhere, from your sidebar to your page heading without, no breakpoints or layout specific styling. When used effectively, this can reduce your typographic styles by up to 90% and save 20% of your time as you will write far fewer typographic styles. Typetura also supports variable font adjustments, easing curves, is progressively enhanced, and is styled with CSS to offer the most feature rich and easy to use experience possible. We also offer [pre-typeset packages](https://typetura.com/typography-packages) and [assistance integrating Typetura into your projects](https://typetura.com/typography-services).

# Installation

```
npm install --save @typetura/react
```

# Configuration

Where you initialize your app, add the following configuration:

```javascript
initializeTypetura({
  withPackage: {
    apiKey: '<YOUR_TYPETURA_DOT_COM_API_KEY>',
    name: 'bullseye',
  },
  selectors: [':root', '.typetura', 'main', 'article', 'section', 'aside'], // default: ['.typetura],
});
```

If you have a [Typetura account](https://typetura.com/auth/create-account), configure what package you wish to use in `withPackage`. You can browse packages at [Typetura.com](https://typetura.com/typography-packages). If you do not wish to use a package and want to write custom styles for your typography, then simply leave this setting off.

Contexts create areas of the page that Typetura styling will respond to. For example, if you want headlines to respond to the context of a side bar, add the selector you are using for that side bar here. There are other ways to create these contexts as well that we will go over in [Usage](#usage).

## Using a Typetura package

If you are using a [Typetura package](https://typetura.com/typography-packages), the styles are pre determined on the following components:

```jsx
const ReactExample = () => {
  return (
    <Typetura.Big>Big</Typetura.Big>
    <Typetura.Blockquote>Blockquote</Typetura.Blockquote>
    <Typetura.Caption>Caption</Typetura.Caption>
    <Typetura.Meta>Meta</Typetura.Meta>
    <Typetura.PrimaryHeadline>PrimaryHeadline</Typetura.PrimaryHeadline>
    <Typetura.PrimarySubheadline>PrimarySubheadline</Typetura.PrimarySubheadline>
    <Typetura.Pullquote>Pullquote</Typetura.Pullquote>
    <Typetura.SectionHeadline>SectionHeadline</Typetura.SectionHeadline>
    <Typetura.SectionLabel>SectionLabel</Typetura.SectionLabel>
    <Typetura.SectionSubheadline>SectionSubheadline</Typetura.SectionSubheadline>
    <Typetura.Small>Small</Typetura.Small>
  );
}
```

These components allow you to quickly build typographically rich pages that work in any layout without the need for additional styling. The components themselves also create new contexts for themselves, meaning you can spend less time managing these contexts.
